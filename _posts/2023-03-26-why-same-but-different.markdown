Well, let's first read ChatGPT's definition of this idiom:

> The expression "same but different" usually refers to something that has similarities with something else but also has distinct differences. It's often used to describe things that may appear similar at first glance but upon closer examination, have unique qualities that set them apart.
> 
> For example, two paintings may be the same in terms of subject matter or style, but one may have different colors, composition, or brushwork. Or two people may have similar personalities, but one may have different habits, interests, or experiences that make them unique.
> 
> Overall, the phrase "same but different" implies that there is a balance between familiarity and novelty, and that even though two things may share certain characteristics, they can still be interesting and valuable in their own right.

Actually it is my perception of human beings between unicity and universality. In this blog, I am sharing my personal thoughts with the hope they would have echo for other readers.

The ✌️ is an emoji I like, it has a couple of meanings but all with positively overtone. It is also a summary of unicity (one hand) and multiplicity (two raised fingers) which sticked well to the blog's title!
