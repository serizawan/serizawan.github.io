A wicked sorcerer has captured ten dwarves and decides to challenge them with a logical challenge.

The ten dwarves are forced to queue in a straight line, with the tallest dwarf at the back and the shortest dwarf at the front.

The sorcerer put either a black hat or a white hat on each dwarf's head at his discretion. Any possible combination of black and white hats is possible without any constraint on the number of hats by colour.

Each dwarf can see the color of the hats of the dwarves in front of him, but cannot see neither the color of his own hat nor the hats of the dwarves behind him.

The sorcerer informs the dwarves that he will ask each of them, starting with the tallest, to guess the color of his own hat. If a dwarf guesses correctly, he will be set free. If a dwarf guesses incorrectly, he will be turned into a toad. Dwarves hear the guess (and the rightness) of their previous fellows. The dwarves are allowed to confer before the sorcerer puts hats on their head. Once the guessing begins, they may not communicate with one another in any way.

What strategy can the dwarves use to maximize the number of dwarves who guess correctly, and how many dwarves can they guarantee will be set free?
